Real-Time Attendance System
The Real-Time Attendance System ensures accurate monitoring of student presence in the classroom. It registers attendance as soon as a student enters the class and pauses if the student leaves, such as for a restroom break. Attendance only counts if the student remains in the class for a total of at least 60 minutes. This system guarantees precise tracking of student attendance, ensuring accountability and reliability.
